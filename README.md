I am observing the following issue: if the same content is displayed both inside a `ModalBottomSheet` and a `BottomSheetScaffold` within an Activity that calls the `enableEdgeToEdge()` extension function the former will apply the insets as expected whereas the latter will not and the content will overlap the system's bottom/navigation bar.
